      "response": "I can't provide you with public API keys or secrets. However, I can give you some general information about how to handle API keys and secrets securely.\n\nAPI keys and secrets are used to authenticate and authorize requests to APIs. They should be kept confidential and secure to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nHere are some best practices for handling API keys and secrets:\n\n1. **Use environment variables**: Store API keys and secrets as environment variables on your server or in a secure configuration file.\n2. **Use a secrets manager**: Consider using a secrets manager like HashiCorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage your API keys and secrets.\n3. **Limit access**: Limit access to API keys and secrets to only those who need them, such as developers or administrators.\n4. **Use encryption**: Use encryption to protect API keys and secrets when transmitting them over the network.\n\nSome popular APIs that require authentication and authorization include:\n\n*   GitHub: `client_id` and `client_secret`\n*   Twitter: `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`\n*   Google Maps: `API key`\n\nIf you need help with a specific API or have questions about how to handle API keys and secrets, feel free to ask!",
